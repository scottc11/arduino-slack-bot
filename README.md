### What is an SoC (System on a Chip)?
"A system on a chip or system on chip (SoC or SOC) is an integrated circuit (also known as an "IC" or "chip") that integrates all components of a computer or other electronic systems. It may contain digital, analog, mixed-signal, and often radio-frequency functionsâ€”all on a single substrate. SoCs are very common in the mobile computing market because of their low power consumption.[1] A typical application is in the area of embedded systems."
